This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
cd .. # in root of repo
pnpm install
pnpm dev  # Starts app, database, schema workspaces in development mode
```

The application uses `@lxcat/database` package which needs a ArangoDB database server, see its [README](../packages/database/README.md) how to setup the database.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

The `src/pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Setup auth

The app can use [Orcid](https://orcid.org), [Auth0](https://auth0.com/), [Keycloak](http://www.keycloak.org/) or [GitLab Appliction](https://gitlab.com/-/profile/applications) to perform authentication. User management is stored in the ArangoDB users collection.

### In auth0 dashboard

1. Create a new application of type `Regular Web Applications`.

   - Allowed Callback URLs
     - For dev deployment set to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/auth0`
   - Allowed Logout URLs
     - For dev deployment set to `http://localhost:3000`

2. Make sure `disable sign ups` is disabled in auth0 authentication database settings. So users can register themselves.

### In GitLab application settings

1. Create a [new application](https://gitlab.com/-/profile/applications)

   - Redirect URI
     - For dev deployments set to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/gitlab`
   - Scopes
     - Select `read_user`, `openid`, `profile` and `email`

### For Orcid sandbox

1. Register on [https://sandbox.orcid.org/](https://sandbox.orcid.org/)

   - Only one app can be registered per orcid account, so use alias when primary account already has an registered app.
   - Use `<something>@mailinator.com` as email, because to register app you need a verified email and Orcid sandbox only sends mails to `mailinator.com`.

2. Goto [https://www.mailinator.com/v4/public/inboxes.jsp](https://www.mailinator.com/v4/public/inboxes.jsp) and search for `<something>` and verify your email adress
3. Goto [https://sandbox.orcid.org/account](https://sandbox.orcid.org/account), make email public for everyone
4. Goto [https://sandbox.orcid.org/developer-tools](https://sandbox.orcid.org/developer-tools) to register for public API.

   - Your website URL
     - Does not allow localhost URL, so use `https://lxcat.net`
   - Redirect URI
     - For dev deployments set to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/orcidsandbox`

### For Orcid

1. Register on [https://orcid.org/](https://orcid.org/)

   - Only one app can be registered per orcid account, so use alias when primary account already has an registered app.

2. Goto [https://orcid.org/developer-tools](https://orcid.org/developer-tools) to register for public API.

   - Your website URL
     - Does not allow localhost URL, so use `https://lxcat.net`
   - Redirect URI, requires https
     - For dev deployments the nextjs server on <http://localhost:3000> has to be reversed-proxied to https
       This can be done with [caddyserver](https://caddyserver.com/)

       ```sh
       caddy run
       # This will ask for sudo login to install a CA certificate into local trust store so browser trusts the URL
       ```

       This will make app available on [https://localhost:8443](https://localhost:8443).
       In Orcid site set the redirect URL to `https://localhost:8443/api/auth/callback/orcid`.
       Also set `NEXT_PUBLIC_URL=https://localhost:8443` in `.env.local` file.
     - For production deployments set to `https://< lxcat domain >/api/auth/callback/orcid`
       Also set `NEXT_PUBLIC_URL=https://< lxcat domain >` in `.env.local` file.

### For Keycloak

[Keycloak](http://www.keycloak.org/) is an open source oauth provider which can be used for local accounts in production.

<details>
<summary>How to configure keycloak</summary>

First spinup a container with

```shell
docker run --rm  -p 8080:8080 -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN=admin -e KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:18.0.2 start-dev
```

Goto http://localhost:8080/admin/master/console and login with admin:admin.

1. [Create realm](http://localhost:8080/admin/master/console/#/create/realm) called `lxcat-test-realm`
2. [Create users](http://localhost:8080/admin/master/console/#/realms/lxcat-test-real/users)
   - The password must be set in Credentials tab, dont forget to turn off `temporary` field.
   - Set `orcid` and `picture` in Attributes tab to `0000-0001-2345-6789` and `/lxcat.png` respectively.
3. [Create client](http://localhost:8080/admin/master/console/#/create/client/lxcat-test-real). This is the oauth provider the lxcat app will authenticate against.
   - Client ID: lxcat-test
   - Client protocol: openid-connect
   - Root URL: http://localhost:3000 or whatever url the application is running on.
   - After creation edit client some more
   - Access type: confidential
   - To Valid Redirect URIs field add `https://localhost:3000/*`
   - Save it
   - On Mappers tab create mapper to expose orcid and picture user attributes
     - orcid mapper
       - Name: orcid
       - Mapper type: User Attribute
       - User attribute: orcid
       - Token Claim Name: orcid
       - Claim JSON Type: string
       - Save it
     - picture mapper
       - Name: picture
       - Mapper type: User Attribute
       - User attribute: picture
       - Token Claim Name: picture
       - Claim JSON Type: string
   - On creditials tab copy Secret value to KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET in /app/e2e/.env.test file.

</details>

### In local directory

In `.env.local` file define the following key/value pairs

```env
# Used as root url for absolute URLs
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL=<URL where users visit server, like http://localhost:3000>
# Where openid identity provider should redirect back to
NEXTAUTH_URL=<URL where users visit server, like http://localhost:3000>
# Secret used to sign JWT api tokens
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<Random string>
# Password used to connect to database
ARANGO_PASSWORD=<Arangodb root password>
ARANGO_ROOT_PASSWORD=<Arangodb root password used in docker>
# When you want to use Auth0 as identity provider set the AUTH0_* vars
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=<Client ID from Auth0 application settings page>
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=<Client secret from Auth0 application settings page>
AUTH0_ISSUER=<Domain from Auth0 application settings page with `https://` prepended>
# When you want to use GitLab as identity provider set the GITLAB_* vars
GITLAB_CLIENT_ID=<Application ID from GitLab application page>
GITLAB_CLIENT_SECRET=<Client secret from GitLab application page>
# When you want to use Orcid as identity provider set the ORCID_* vars
ORCID_CLIENT_ID=<Client ID from Orcid developer tools page>
ORCID_CLIENT_SECRET=<Client secret from Orcid developer tools page>
# To use Orcid sandbox instead of production Orcid set following var
ORCID_SANDBOX=True
# When you want to use Keycloak as identity provider set the KEYCLOAK_* vars
KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID=<Client ID from Keycloak client page>
KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET=<Client secret from credentials tab on the Keycloak client page>
KEYCLOAK_ISSUER=<Keycloak base url and realm. eg. http://localhost:8080/realms/master>
```

At least one identity provider should be configured.

## End to end tests

The end to end tests (`e2e/**.spec.ts`) are written and run using [playwright](https://playwright.dev/).

Before running test ensure playwright's chromium browser is installed with

```shell
npx playwright install chromium
```

Also make sure port 8001, 8002, and 8003 are not in use.

```shell
pnpm test:e2e
```

To debug and record add `await page.pause()` and run tests with

```shell
pnpm test:e2e -- --headed
```

The test command spins up the app dev server, ArangoDB in a Docker container, a test OpenID connect server and then executes the tests in the `e2e/` directory.

```mermaid
graph TD
    playwright --> g[global setup]
    g -->|test container| a[ArangoDB:8003]
    g --> o[test OpenID connect server:8002]
    playwright --> d[app dev server:8001]
    playwright -->|execute| t[tests]
```

The `e2e/global-setup.ts` file is used as playwrights global setup to spinup the ArangoDB and test identity provider. It also

- signs up admin user, to become admin user in tests add `test.use({ storageState: "adminStorageState.json" });`
- has utility functions to fill or truncate database

The `e2e/test-oidc-server.ts` file contains a OpenID connect server which accepts any email/password combination and returns
a dummy profile with orcid and picture. The application configures its client by using the `TESTOIDC_CLIENT_*` env vars.

## Unit Tests

See [code contributor doc](../docs/code-contributor#unit-tests)

## Optimizations

To see which modules are loaded by web browser use

```shell
ANALYZE=true pnpm build
```

Command writes `.next/analyze/client.html`.
