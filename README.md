## Installation

To get familiar with the code read the following documentation:

- [docs/code-contributor.md](docs/code-contributor.md) for technology choices.
- [app/README.md](app/README.md) for web application and web service.
- [packages/database/README.md](packages/database/README.md) for spinning up the
  database and filling it.
- [packages/schema/README.md](packages/schema/README.md) for JSON schemas,
  validators and Typescript types of LXCat documents.
- [packages/converter/README.md](packages/converter/README.md) for conversion to
  the legacy LXCat format.

## Documentation

Documentation for different users can be found at [docs/](docs/).

## Production deployment

Create `.env` file with content similar to `.env.local` described in
[app/README.md](app/README.md).

Startup containers with

```shell
docker-compose up --build
```

Fill database with

```shell
docker-compose run setup setup
# To seed db with test data set use
docker-compose run setup seed seeds/test
# To seed db with production data use
# The `./database/seeds` directory is bind mounted inside the Docker container,
# so copy any seed files to that directory
cp -r <production data seed> ./packages/database/seeds/<production data seed>
docker-compose run setup load-css /packages/database/seeds/<production data seed>
# To give an already logged in user admin rights
docker-compose run setup make-admin <email of user>
```

Web application will run at `http://localhost:3000`. The app should be reversed
proxied by a web server to provide https.
