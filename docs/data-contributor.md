stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> draft: start
    draft --> published: publish
    draft --> [*]: delete
    published --> archived: archival of previous published
    published --> retracted
    published --> draft: update
```

* **draft**: Only visible by organization members in author pages after authentication.
* **published**: Visible on search page.
* **archived**: Not visible on search page. Details page renders with warning that there is a newer version.
* **retracted**: Not visible on search page. Details pages renders with warning that it should not be used.

A cross section version or cross section set version can be in any of the statuses depicted above.
A draft, published, archived version of a cross section are connected using a graph to make a history table of the cross section like

| ID   | Version | Status    | Comment    | Created on |
| ---- | ------- | --------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 1111 | 1       | archived  | Initial    | 1 Jan 2022 |
