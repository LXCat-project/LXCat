## Filtering cross section sets

On the [cross section sets](/scat-css) page you can filter cross section sets based on 
* species: species consumed in the cross section reaction. Electron is excluded
* contributing organization
* reaction type

Selecting a species will expand to show charge choices and show all cross section sets that have the selected particle as a consumed species in one of its cross sections.

Deeper selections will expand more of the tree and show electronic, rotational and vibrational choices.
