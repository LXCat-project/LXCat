## Filtering cross section sets

On the [cross section sets](/scat-css) page you can filter cross section sets based on

- the species consumed in a reaction in the cross section set. The electron is excluded
  from this list,
- the contributing organization,
- and the reaction type.

Selecting a species will expand to show charge choices and show all cross section sets
that have the selected particle as a consumed species in one of its cross sections.

Deeper selections will expand more of the tree and show electronic, vibrational, and
rotational choices.
